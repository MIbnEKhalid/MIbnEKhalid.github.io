*Note: To ensure clean and user-friendly URLs, HTML files are organized within directories named after their respective content, with each directory containing an `index.html` file. This approach facilitates clean URLs, enhancing readability and SEO performance.*

#### Example:

Instead of using `UserAgreement.html`:
- Bad URL: [https://mbktech.xyz/UserAgreement.html](https://mbktech.xyz/UserAgreement.html)

Use `UserAgreement/index.html`:
  - Good URL: [https://mbktech.xyz/UserAgreement/](https://mbktech.xyz/UserAgreement/)

In the root file, we have the home page `root/index.html` as its main page.
